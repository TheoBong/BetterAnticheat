# BetterAnticheat

**BEFORE INSTALLING, PLEASE READ:** 

BetterAnticheat is an auxiliary anticheat. BetterAnticheat does not aim to and will not catch cheats like flight, speed,
reach, etc. BetterAnticheat exists to catch more niche cheats that many anticheats do not catch on their own, meaning it
should be run alongside another anticheat.

BetterAnticheat is written in a way where it does not send any packets other than chat messages and will not alter any
packets coming to the server. This means that there should not be any incompatibilities with other plugins unless that
other plugin creates an incompatibility.

It is also designed to be lightweight, platform-independent, and designed with a 0-buffer system where if a check flags
it means the player is running a non-vanilla client. It should be noted that it is entirely possible that the plugin
will not help you at all - a lot of checks are extremely niche or patch exploits that aren't common anymore. However,
all checks in the anticheat do protect your server from possibly malicious behavior.
